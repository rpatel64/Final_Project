Short Report:
I thought this challenge went well as a whole; however, I was unsure on somethings.
First, I like how the challenge prepares us for what we will have to turn in for
the final report. I also like that is kind of forces us to meet up and work on the
project and not procrastinate. I did not really understand how the points worked.
I based my points on like if my work was worth 100 percent. I give more percentage
to the work that required the most time and effort.
